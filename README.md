# EdisonRadio
Internet Radio ESP32 based on Ed's Smallenburg's version but with some enhancements
You'll find all the information about firmware hardware, web interface, building instruction etc. in the documentation folder


If you are using the same hardware wiring as me...you can also upload the pre compiled sketch ( bin file) directly to your ESP32

Use edge or chrome browser for this to work and before you upload, run the init sketch once...
